AB The Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations at different fidelity levels are a common tool for predicting the aerodynamic performance in many engineering applications such as; automotive and aerospace to cite a few. However, the associated computational costs with these simulations are not trivial, and using the CFD simulations might easily become unpractical specially at the early design stages. The number of the required CFD simulations could be reduced immensely by using Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods which can predict, for example, the aerodynamic coefficients based on previous and limited CFD simulations. Having discussed the AI potential to minimize the CFD usage, the objective of this work is to investigate and compare the ability of different AI methods to predict the aerodynamic coefficients using the same CFD database from the literature. In this study, three different AI methods, namely; machine learning (e.g. Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), CatBoost, Bagging, Light Gradient Boosting Machine (Light-GBM), Random Forest (RFR), Gradient Boosting), deep learning (e.g. One Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (Conv1D)) and surrogate models (e.g. Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)) have been utilized to estimate a sample CFD database (e.g. NACA0012, RAE2822) from the existing literature, and the prediction performance of these methods have been compared. The results show that, the aerodynamic coefficients predicted using CatBoost, XGB and Bagging are in good agreement with the reference CFD results. Furthermore, the proposed Conv1D method with LeakyReLU activation function showed a promising results in the development of aerodynamic models which can be used in the early stages of the air vehicles design. The obtained results from this work indicate that the CatBoost and the XGB models required much smaller training time compared to the Conv1D method, moreover, the proposed regression trees; CatBoost, Bagging and XGB can reduce the required number of CFD simulations significantly.

AB Artificial Intelligence (AI) use in automated Electrocardiogram (ECG) classification has continuously attracted the research community's interest, motivated by their promising results. Despite their great promise, limited attention has been paid to the robustness of their results, which is a key element for their implementation in clinical practice. Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is a critical for trustworthy and reliable AI, particularly in safety-critical domains such as medicine. Estimating uncertainty in Machine Learning (ML) model predictions has been extensively used for Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection under single-label tasks. However, the use of UQ methods in multi-label classification remains underexplored. This study goes beyond developing highly accurate models comparing five uncertainty quantification methods using the same Deep Neural Network (DNN) architecture across various validation scenarios, including internal and external validation as well as OOD detection, taking multi-label ECG classification as the example domain. We show the importance of external validation and its impact on classification performance, uncer-tainty estimates quality, and calibration. Ensemble-based methods yield more robust uncertainty estimations than single network or stochastic methods. Although current methods still have limitations in accurately quantifying uncertainty, particularly in the case of dataset shift, incorporating uncertainty estimates with a classification with a rejection option improves the ability to detect such changes. Moreover, we show that using uncertainty estimates as a criterion for sample selection in active learning setting results in greater improvements in classification performance compared to random sampling.

AB Background and objective: Obstructive airway diseases, including asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), are two of the most common chronic respiratory health problems. Both of these conditions require health professional expertise in making a diagnosis. Hence, this process is time intensive for healthcare providers and the diagnostic quality is subject to intra-and inter-operator variability. In this study we investigate the role of automated detection of obstructive airway diseases to reduce cost and improve diagnostic quality.Methods: We investigated the existing body of evidence and applied Preferred Reporting Items for Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to search records in IEEE, Google scholar, and PubMed databases. We identified 65 papers that were published from 2013 to 2022 and these papers cover 67 different studies. The review process was structured according to the medical data that was used for disease detection. We identified six main categories, namely air flow, genetic, imaging, signals, and miscellaneous. For each of these categories, we report both disease detection methods and their performance.Results: We found that medical imaging was used in 14 of the reviewed studies as data for automated obstructive airway disease detection. Genetics and physiological signals were used in 13 studies. Medical records and air flow were used in 9 and 7 studies, respectively. Most papers were published in 2020 and we found three times more work on Machine Learning (ML) when compared to Deep Learning (DL). Statistical analysis shows that DL techniques achieve higher Accuracy (ACC) when compared to ML. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is the most common DL classifier and Support Vector Machine (SVM) is the most widely used ML classifier. During our review, we discovered only two publicly available asthma and COPD datasets. Most studies used private clinical datasets, so data size and data composition are inconsistent.Conclusions: Our review results indicate that Artificial Intelligence (AI) can improve both decision quality and efficiency of health professionals during COPD and asthma diagnosis. However, we found several limitations in this review, such as a lack of dataset consistency, a limited dataset and remote monitoring was not sufficiently explored. We appeal to society to accept and trust computer aided airflow obstructive diseases diagnosis and we encourage health professionals to work closely with AI scientists to promote automated detection in clinical practice and hospital settings.

AB Analysis of the effect of pressure on the unsymmetrical plan-shaped buildings due to impact of wind forces is more complicated than the symmetrical plan-shaped buildings. Toward this, the present paper is focuses on the study of the wind effects on the inner face of C-shaped unconventional buildings by considering the surface mean pressure coefficient (Cp over bar ) as the major influencing parameter. Experimental investigation was carried out to obtain the pressure coefficient (Cp) over the surfaces of the C-shaped building models by considering some important configurations like the side ratio, frontal ratio, height ratio, and angle of incidence in a subsonic wind tunnel. In the present study, model equations to predict the Cp over bar are developed by applying various artificial intelligence (AI) approaches such as the model tree (MT) and group method of data handling (GMDH) with neural network (GMDH-NN) as well as combinatorial (GMDH-C) algorithm to the experimental results. In the AI approach, the side width ratio (D/d), frontal ratio (B/d), depth ratio (H/d), relative width ratio (B/b), angle of incidence (& theta;), and face angle (& phi;) are considered as input to the algorithm to develop the model equation for predicting Cp over bar . The performances of the model equations are tested through various statistical error analyses. The importance of input parameters is also analyzed through the sensitivity analysis technique. The results clearly indicate that the proposed GMDH-NN model is the best alternative approach to predict the surface mean pressure coefficient on C-shaped buildings with coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.96 and 0.92 during the training and testing phases respectively. To verify the model equation more accurately, the predicted results are also tested through uncertainty analysis which gave satisfactory results for GMDH-NN as compared to MT and GMDH-C, approaches.
