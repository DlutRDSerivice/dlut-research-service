Investigation on the abilities of different artificial intelligence methods to predict the aerodynamic coefficients,"The Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations at different fidelity levels are a common tool for predicting the aerodynamic performance in many engineering applications such as; automotive and aerospace to cite a few. However, the associated computational costs with these simulations are not trivial, and using the CFD simulations might easily become unpractical specially at the early design stages. The number of the required CFD simulations could be reduced immensely by using Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods which can predict, for example, the aerodynamic coefficients based on previous and limited CFD simulations. Having discussed the AI potential to minimize the CFD usage, the objective of this work is to investigate and compare the ability of different AI methods to predict the aerodynamic coefficients using the same CFD database from the literature. In this study, three different AI methods, namely; machine learning (e.g. Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), CatBoost, Bagging, Light Gradient Boosting Machine (Light-GBM), Random Forest (RFR), Gradient Boosting), deep learning (e.g. One Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (Conv1D)) and surrogate models (e.g. Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)) have been utilized to estimate a sample CFD database (e.g. NACA0012, RAE2822) from the existing literature, and the prediction performance of these methods have been compared. The results show that, the aerodynamic coefficients predicted using CatBoost, XGB and Bagging are in good agreement with the reference CFD results. Furthermore, the proposed Conv1D method with LeakyReLU activation function showed a promising results in the development of aerodynamic models which can be used in the early stages of the air vehicles design. The obtained results from this work indicate that the CatBoost and the XGB models required much smaller training time compared to the Conv1D method, moreover, the proposed regression trees; CatBoost, Bagging and XGB can reduce the required number of CFD simulations significantly.1",
Evaluation of uncertainty quantification methods in multi-label classification: A case study with automatic diagnosis of electrocardiogram,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) use in automated Electrocardiogram (ECG) classification has continuously attracted the research community's interest, motivated by their promising results. Despite their great promise, limited attention has been paid to the robustness of their results, which is a key element for their implementation in clinical practice. Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is a critical for trustworthy and reliable AI, particularly in safety-critical domains such as medicine. Estimating uncertainty in Machine Learning (ML) model predictions has been extensively used for Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection under single-label tasks. However, the use of UQ methods in multi-label classification remains underexplored. This study goes beyond developing highly accurate models comparing five uncertainty quantification methods using the same Deep Neural Network (DNN) architecture across various validation scenarios, including internal and external validation as well as OOD detection, taking multi-label ECG classification as the example domain. We show the importance of external validation and its impact on classification performance, uncer-tainty estimates quality, and calibration. Ensemble-based methods yield more robust uncertainty estimations than single network or stochastic methods. Although current methods still have limitations in accurately quantifying uncertainty, particularly in the case of dataset shift, incorporating uncertainty estimates with a classification with a rejection option improves the ability to detect such changes. Moreover, we show that using uncertainty estimates as a criterion for sample selection in active learning setting results in greater improvements in classification performance compared to random sampling.",
